# Inner Dialogue — Two-Column Journal

A simple journaling tool for having a conversation with yourself. This app is inspired by therapeutic practices like **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** or **chair work**, where one voice (a part, or your inner child) speaks, and another voice (your Self, adult, or inner wisdom) responds.

You don’t need any technical skills to use it. Just open the app, type in one column, and then switch to the other column. The back‑and‑forth creates a written dialogue that you can revisit later.

## How to Use It

- **Start on the left**: Write as your Part (or child voice).
- **Press Enter** when you’re ready to send that thought.
  - **Shift+Enter** lets you add a new line without sending.
- After you press Enter, the cursor moves to the **right column**, where you can write as your Self (adult voice).
- Press Enter again and it cycles back to the left.

> **Tip:** Don’t use the Tab key to switch between columns. If you Tab away, your text may not save.

When you’re done with a dialogue, hit **End & Save**. The session will appear in the sidebar with a timestamp. You can:

- **Search** through all past dialogues (by date or text).
- **Click** on an old one to read it.
- **Continue** where you left off if the conversation wasn’t finished.

## Privacy & Your Data

Your data is **never uploaded anywhere**. Everything is stored right inside your web browser on your own device.

- This is done through something called **local storage**, which is basically like your browser’s notepad.
- It means the app works **offline**, with no internet connection needed.
- It also means your data **does not sync** between devices. If you use it on your laptop, those conversations won’t appear on your phone.

**Important:**

- If you **clear your browser’s cache or site data**, your dialogues may be erased.
- Some phones automatically clear data for apps you don’t use often, which can also delete your stored conversations.

To be safe, you can **Export** your dialogues. This creates a file (in JSON format) that you can:

- Save to Dropbox, Google Drive, or the Files app.
- Email to yourself as a backup.

Later, you can **Import** that file back into the app on the same or another device. The app skips duplicates, so you won’t get doubles.

## Extra Features

- **Copy as Text**: turn a dialogue into a simple transcript.
- **Search**: find dialogues by keyword or date.
- **Delete**: remove individual dialogues from your history.

## Technical Details (in plain English)

- The app is a single HTML file. You can download it and open it directly from your computer — no installation needed.
- Works completely offline.
- Local storage is tied to your browser. Clear that storage, and the data is gone.
- Exports and imports are JSON files, which are just structured text files your computer can store anywhere.
